                        Flowers have hidden attributes and have been used medicinally for thousands of years.
                        The fossil Archaefructus Sinensis is claimed to be the oldest flower in the world.
                        The Titan Arum is the world’s largest flower.
                        Flowers are the reproductive part of flowering plants.
                        Some flowers close at night, while others bloom all at once at night.
                        There are no white or black flowers.
                        The smallest flower in the world is Wolffia globose.
                        Sunflower heads move throughout the day with the direction of the sun.                    </div>

                        Night or nighttime is the period of darkness when the Sun is below the horizon. The opposite of nighttime is daytime. Sunlight illuminates one side of the Earth, leaving the other in darkness. Earth's rotation causes the appearance of sunrise and sunset. Moonlight, airglow, starlight, and light pollution dimly illuminate night. The duration of day, night, and twilight varies depending on the time of year and the latitude. Night on other celestial bodies is affected by their rotation and orbital periods.

                        Plants are autotrophs, which means they make their own food with the help of sunlight and water.There are about 380,000 known species of plants, of which the majority, some 260,000, produce seeds.Green plants provide a substantial proportion of the world's molecular oxygen and are the basis of most of Earth's ecosystems.
                        Trees have the longest lifespan of all organisms.An average size tree can provide enough wood to make 170,100 pencils5.The Amazon rainforest produces half the world’s oxygen supply.

                        A river is a natural course of water, usually freshwater, flowing toward an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river.
                        There are at least 41,000 cubic feet of water flowing in the river. Even though Congo River is not the longest river, it takes the record as the second longest river in Africa. We can say that Congo River is the most powerful river in Africa.
                        The current describes how fast and powerful the river is. Rivers change over time. The longest river in the world is the Nile in Africa. Rivers can carve out canyons in the landscape.
